# build.sh -- one-step build for the Clojure binding: libitb3.so + JNI
# shim + Java binding jars (via the sibling bindings/java/build.sh),
# then a classpath prepare + compile check of the Clojure namespaces
# with reflection warnings treated as errors. Prerequisites (Go,
# JDK 17+, Gradle, Clojure CLI, gcc) must be installed separately;
# see README.md "Prerequisites" section.
#
# The build starts from an empty tree: the compiled target directory
# and the Clojure CLI's project-local classpath cache are removed
# first, so no output can survive from an earlier invocation.
#
# .cpcache is the artefact that matters most here. deps.edn resolves
# the Java binding through an exact version-bearing path, and the cache
# records the resolved classpath keyed on the deps.edn timestamp, so a
# cache written against a jar that no longer exists is what surfaces as
# NoClassDefFoundError at run time rather than as a build failure.
#
# The Java binding layer is a shared producer, not something this
# binding owns, so it is never deleted from here: bindings/java/build.sh
# is invoked instead and performs its own clean, which is what
# guarantees the jar deps.edn names is the current one. Running that
# producer build first also means neither the eitb launcher nor a test
# run can trigger a Java-layer rebuild of its own mid-run.
#
# Set ITB_SKIP_CLEAN=1 to keep the existing artefacts and build
# incrementally; it propagates to the Java layer as well. With no
# environment set the wipe always runs.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh             # default build (full asm stack)
#   ./build.sh --noitbasm  # opt out of ITB's SIMD asm kernels
