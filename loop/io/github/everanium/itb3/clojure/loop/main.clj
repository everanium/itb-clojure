  "Long-run stress harness. The loop utility holds one Pipeline handle
  per exercised cipher surface for minutes, hammers it with concurrent
  encrypt → decrypt → compare round-trips from N worker threads,
  rotates the outer masters and reopens the handle from its session
  blob on a schedule, and reports whether the process survived with
  every byte intact. It is the Clojure binding's counterpart of the Go
  harness under tools/loop: the same flags, the same round structure,
  the same summary in both renderings.

  The default shape is full production: the Streaming AEAD profile
  with parallax on, wrapper on, hmac-blake3 MAC, Areion-SoEM-512 inner
  hash, 1024-bit keys, and the profile's 512-bit nonce width, driven
  through a stream session by three workers for five minutes on 16 MiB
  plaintexts. Every worker owns a distinct CSPRNG-generated plaintext
  held for the whole run, so any cross-call state leakage inside the
  Pipeline surfaces as a data mismatch between workers rather than
  cancelling out.

  A failure is one of two things. A cipher, rekey or load call that
  returns a non-OK status is a worker error: the run stops, the
  summary lists it, the verdict is FAIL and the exit code 1. A
  round-trip that returns without error but with different bytes is a
  data mismatch: the process terminates on the spot with exit code 3,
  printing the worker, the iteration and the first differing offset,
  and no summary — the state that produced the wrong bytes is the
  evidence. A crash inside the shared library or the host runtime has
  no exit code of its own here; surfacing it is what the utility is
  for. Every call goes through the Clojure binding's own namespaces,
  which sit on the Java binding's JNI proxy, so a Go c-shared runtime
  and a HotSpot JVM share one process — the interaction the long run
  is meant to expose.

  Usage:

    ./run_loop.sh --duration 5m --goroutines 3 --shape stream \\
        --hash areion512 --mac hmac-blake3 --payload-size 16MB \\
        --memlimit auto --parallax on --wrapper on

  Ctrl-C triggers a graceful shutdown: in-flight iterations complete,
  then the partial summary prints."
